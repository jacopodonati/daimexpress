## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you'll need to have MongoDB installed on your system. Ensure that MongoDB is running and accessible.

Before running the application, you'll need to configure the connection to your MongoDB database. Inside the `config` directory, you'll find a file named `config.example.js`. Open this file and replace the placeholder values with your MongoDB connection string and domain information. Once you've done this, rename the file to `config.js`.

After configuring the database connection, you can start the application. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. Once the installation is complete, start the application by running `npm start`.

With the application running, open your web browser and navigate to the `/setup` page of your website. This page will guide you through populating the database with initial data. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. Once the setup is done, you can begin using the application.
